# TicTacToe
A Python program, ttt.py that plays tic-tac-toe against a human opponent, with the human player moving first (`X'). The program will show the states of the game board doing the game, and report the number of search tree nodes generated foreach move by the computer, using a regular Minimax algorithm.
